- 👋 Hi, I’m @santoro-mariano. I'm from Argentina and I'm currently living in USA
- 👀 I’m interested in Software, 3D printing, electronics and EV like my onewheel :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github CI/CD (Github workflow/actions)

Currently I'm mainly working on one of my open source projects (the biggest one so far) 👉 [Golden Reports](https://goldenreports.io/)
- PR/Contributions are very welcome!
- The project name is dedicated to my little girl Luna 🐶, the **golden** retriever that's my companion during my one wheel rides.
