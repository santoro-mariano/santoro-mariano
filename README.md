Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mariano Santoro, a passionate software engineer with a knack for turning complex ideas into elegant solutions. Originally from Argentina, I'm now living in the U.S.

Since I was a young teenager, when my mother bought us a used old Pentium 100Mhz running Windows 95 (it was already a pretty old computer back then), I've been immersed in the world of technology, constantly learning and pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

When I'm not coding, you can find me tinkering with electronics, 3D printing unique designs, or crafting something in my woodworking shop. I'm also a proud dog dad to Charlie and Luna, who keep me company during late-night coding sessions.

My work often explores the intersection of cutting-edge software architecture and practical engineering. From building scalable microservices with event-driven architecture and CQRS to experimenting with GraphQL and custom REST endpoints, I'm always looking for new challenges.

I'm currently building [my own software company](https://wolfware.dev), offering innovative SaaS products, and if you're interested in staying in the loop, consider subscribing to our updates!

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
